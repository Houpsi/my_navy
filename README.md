# My_navy
# {EPITECH} | First year | Unix System programming project

## Description

The My_navy project aims to recreate the classic Battleship game using signals. The game is played on an 8x8 grid, and each turn involves displaying the player's positions followed by the enemy's positions. 
The game concludes when all of a player's ships have been hit, determining the winner.

The file passed as parameter must contain lines formatted the following way:  
`LENGTH : FIRST_SQUARE : LAST_SQUARE`  
where LENGTH is the length of the ship, FIRST_SQUARE and LAST_SQUARE its first and last positions.
In this file, you must have 4 ships (of lengths 2, 3, 4 and 5).

## Get started

### Compile the programm

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run `make` to build the static library, 
now you have created a binary that can compile the program. You can also use `make clean` to delete the `.o` files created
by the `make` command.  

### Run the program

After successfully compiling the program, execute it with the following command:  
`./my_navy arg1 arg2`  
Replace arg1 and arg2 with the appropriate input parameters. If specific requirements exist for the input arguments, provide that information in this section.
